# yew-todo

This simple Yew Todo application builds off what I've learned from my first [yew app](https://github.com/tieje/yew-counter-app).
For this application, I will be exploring:
- [CSS implementations](https://yew.rs/docs/more/css)
  - Although it seems like the libraries work, all of the UI libraries have been largely abandoned. Something happened and I don't know what.
  - Only [stylist-rs](https://github.com/futursolo/stylist-rs) is still being developed
- [JS with RS, particularly](https://yew.rs/docs/concepts/basic-web-technologies/js)
  - [debugging and console logging](https://yew.rs/docs/more/debugging)
    - log every task added and removed to the console
  - [javascript-only web APIs](https://yew.rs/docs/concepts/basic-web-technologies/js)
    - create a window alert asking the user if they really want to delete a task
